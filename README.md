Salvador, Jessie

# Week 1
- I was introduced to Discrete Mathematics and the topics that would be tackled in the course of this term.
- The importance of specific math subjects were discussed.
- I learned the different meanings of "Truth" and how it will relate to DISMATH.

# Week 2
- Logical Connectives were discussed (their meaning, uses and symbols).
-- Focused more on conditional and began looking at the difference with biconditional.

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Usage |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:|
| → | Conditional | if, then |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff |

- The truth table was introduced.
- Identified parts of sentences (subject and predicate)
- Discussed Predicate Logic and Quantifiers (their cases and symbols)
- Introduced the concept of transforming sentences into equations and vice versa.

# Week 3
- Tackled on solving proof via logical equivalences.
- The Rules of Inference was introduced
- Discussed the concept of Tautology
- Discussed the difference between Truth and Validity.

# Week 4
- The different types of proofs were introduced.
- Emphasized the difference between "Contraposition" and "Contradiction"
- Went through an exercise of Mathematical Induction. (Basis and Inductive)
- Discussed Recursive/Inductive "Definition"; A definition, not a proof.
