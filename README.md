Salvador, Jessie

# Week 1
- I was introduced to Discrete Mathematics and the topics that would be tackled in the course of this term.
- The importance of specific math subjects were discussed.
- I learned the different meanings of "Truth" and how it will relate to DISMATH.

# Week 2
- Logical Connectives were discussed (their meaning, uses and symbols).
-- Focused more on conditional and began looking at the difference with biconditional.

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Usage |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:|
| → | Conditional | if, then |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff |

- The truth table was introduced.
- Identified parts of sentences (subject and predicate)
- Discussed Predicate Logic and Quantifiers (their cases and symbols)
- Introduced the concept of transforming sentences into equations and vice versa.

# Week 3
- Tackled on solving proof via logical equivalences.
- The Rules of Inference was introduced
- Discussed the concept of Tautology
- Discussed the difference between Truth and Validity.

# Week 4
- The different types of proofs were introduced.
- Emphasized the difference between "Contraposition" and "Contradiction"
- Went through an exercise of Mathematical Induction. (Basis and Inductive)
- Discussed Recursive/Inductive "Definition"; A definition, not a proof.

# Week 5
- Discussed the steps of checking program correctness.
- Discussed Power Series and Zeno's Paradox (which was proven not valid).
- Began discussion on Sets.

# Week 6
- Discussed functions:
    - One-to-One
    - Onto
    - Not A function (Relation) (ex. radical x)

# Week 7
- Working on MIT App Inventor

# Week 8
- Discussed Algotirthms
- Started on Psuedocodes (Parts of a psuedocode):
    - Input
    - Output
    - Definiteness
    - Correctness
    - Finiteness
    - Generality

# Week 9
- Discussed "Sets"
- Specific Algorithms were discussed:
    - Finding Maximum
    - Finding Minimum
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search

# Week 10
- Discussed more specific algorithms:
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Greedy

# Week 11
- Growth Functions
- The "BIG" Notations:
    - Big-O (upper bound)
    - Big-Theta (upper and lower bound)
    - Big-Omega (lower bound)

# Week 13
- Graph Theory, G=(V,E); Wherein V = Vertices/Nodes and E = Edges
- Handhshake Theorem: 2e= Σ(degrees)*v; used to solve for one of the three (edges, degrees, vertices).
- Euler
    - Euler Path (Passes through all "edges" exactly once, Vfinal does not equal Vinitial [open])
    - Euler Circuit (Passes through all the "edges" exactly once AND Vfinal equal Vinitial [Close])
- Hamilton
    - Hamilton Path (Passes through all "nodes" exactly once [open])
    - Hamilton Circuit (Passes through all "nodes" exactly once AND Vfinal=Vinitial [Close])
- Graphs
    - Isomorphic Graphs: Similar graphs, only orientation is different.
    - Planar Graphs: Edges do not cross over.
    - Euler's Formula: Regions = Edges - Vertices + 2
    - Kuratowski's Theorem: If a graph contoins a subraph similar to a K3 or K5, it is nonplanar.
